# LiriBot

Liri is very similar to Siri by Apple. Unlike SIRI that uses a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI instead uses a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. This is a part of a node application. Liri takes the form of a command line in the node applicaiton. It ingests parameters and relays data back to the user running the program.
